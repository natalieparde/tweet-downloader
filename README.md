# tweet-downloader

This repository contains a simple script that can be used to download the tweets included in Parde and Nielsen's (2017) Twitter dataset for sarcasm detection (it can also be used to download any other tweets for which you have IDs).

The script depends on the Twython Twitter library: https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/twython

To download Twython, check out the above link or type:
pip install twython

or:
easy_install twython

If you use the tweets in this dataset for your own research, please cite the following paper:

Natalie Parde and Rodney D. Nielsen. #SarcasmDetection is soooo general! Towards a Domain-Independent Approach for Detecting Sarcasm. In the Proceedings of the 30th International FLAIRS Conference. Marco Island, Florida, May 22-24, 2017.
